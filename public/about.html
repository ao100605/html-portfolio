<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Japanese-born Chinese who grew up in Beijing and has attended 
  international schools my whole life, currently a sophomore at UCSD studying math-cs. 
  I enjoy watching Chinese dramas, reality TV shows, and anime in my free time. 
  I also like playing fingerstyle guitar for fun.</p>
